# Regression Models with Python

This project demonstrates different regression techniques using Python and scikit-learn:

- Linear Regression
- Polynomial Regression (degree=2 and degree=4)
- Support Vector Regression (SVR)

## Dataset
The dataset contains information about employee levels and their salaries.

## Requirements
- numpy
- pandas
- matplotlib
- scikit-learn

## Preview
Each model is visualized to show how well it fits the data.

## What I Learned
- How to preprocess data for SVR
- The importance of feature scaling
- How to choose between linear and non-linear models
